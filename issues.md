# Current Issues

- Cannot get Chrome to "Allow mic access" from new URLs
  - Chrome will not "allow" new URL's to request microphone access. Currently, on main development computer, local loopback address DOES work. (127.0.0.1:8080). However, cannot get new URL's to work.
  - The major issue this creates is an ability to open this web app on new or different computers. Am also worried about further changes to Chrome, which may 'reset' this list of allowed URL's.
