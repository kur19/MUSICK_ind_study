# MUSICK_ind_study
This is the code and descriptions of work I did for my independent study with Professor Musick.  I'm attempting to set up an HCI experience in a performative environment where the user can query a computer and recieve pre-written, but variable answers.  The goal is to achieve interactivity with an interface that produces different rusults for each performance.
